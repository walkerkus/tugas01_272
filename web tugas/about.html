            <div style="width: 500px;">
                <p>I am an Informatics Engineering student at Universitas Muhammadiyah Surakarta with a deep enthusiasm for programming, software development, and information systems. My academic journey has given me a solid foundation in computer science principles, algorithm design, and various programming languages. I constantly seek opportunities to enhance my technical skills and broaden my knowledge in the field of technology.  

                    Beyond my coursework, I actively engage in projects and hands-on experiences to strengthen my problem-solving abilities. I enjoy working on software development projects, whether independently or collaboratively, as they allow me to apply theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios. My curiosity drives me to explore emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and cloud computing.  
                    
                    I am also passionate about continuous learning and professional growth. The rapidly evolving nature of technology motivates me to stay updated with industry trends and best practices. I embrace challenges as opportunities to improve, and I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to innovative projects. My adaptability and commitment to lifelong learning make me confident in pursuing a successful career in the tech industry. </p>
